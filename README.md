Welcome to my portfolio! 
In my portfolio, you will be able to find many of my previous projects I created along my journey in coding.
These projects involve languages such as HTML, CSS, JS, and Java.

A bit about me:
I aspire to use programming and computer science to create useful things in the future such as medical innovations.
Currently, I learn Java in computer science class, and I have skills working with HTML and CSS to format websites.
Aside from programming in school, I experiment with various other languages such as Swift and C++ in my spare time.
