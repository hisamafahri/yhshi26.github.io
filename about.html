            <p>I'm Yosra Hashim, a direct-entry medical student studying abroad from Canada. I'm currently in year 2/6 for my program which means we're covering clinical aspects through lectures and dissections.</p>
            <p>The time I spent in the lab this year (though limited) definitely stood out to me. It was my first time around donated cadavers and surgical tools. I'll probably write more about the experience in a <a href="posts.html">post</a>, but it's safe to say that the time I spent in the lab had a profound impact on me, and I'm more interested than ever in potentially pursuing a surgical career.</p>
            <p>Outside class, I like to explore my interests from neuroscience to engineering. I'm a member of my university's Computer Science and Internet Society, and Electrical Engineering Society with committee positions in both. With that said, I hope to engage with like-minded peers in the societies and promote my interests such as brain-computer interfacing.</p>	 
	    <p>I'm driven to keep learning, be it on my own or with others. If you have remotely similar interests, feel free to <a href = "mailto:yhshi26@gmail.com?subject = Website&body = Message">contact me</a>. I'm by no means an expert (yet) in neuroscience or engineering, so chances are I'll be hearing some concepts for the first time, but I'll dig as deep as humanly possible into whatever I can and get back to you with my thoughts!</p>
